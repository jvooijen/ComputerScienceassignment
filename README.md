Shopping from the web is nowadays very common which has lead to an increase in the amount of webshops and to an increase in the amount of products sold on those webshops. However, not all those products are unique. Different webshops can sell the same products under different product descriptions and that makes finding duplicates a complicated task. In order to reduce the computation time of comparing different products, Locality-Sensitive Hashing is used. To find the duplicates complete linkage is chosen as a hierarchical clustering method. For this research the data of 1624 descriptions of televisions from 4 different webshops has been used. A maximal in-sample F1* score of 0.1228 is obtained for LSH, averaged over 5 bootstraps . After complete linkage an in-sample F1 score of 0.3267 is obtained.
